
Had Same initial issue and finally sorted it by...

Right click on project and go to Properties

In Java Build Path under the Projects tab there is the associated Project, in my case org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86

Expand this down with the little arrow to the left to display the options. Here I found Native Library Locations. This wasn't set so I selected it and clicked Edit.

In the Popup window that follows, I selected Workspace and then org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86.

Next time I ran the class, it work fine.

I hope this helps someone!
